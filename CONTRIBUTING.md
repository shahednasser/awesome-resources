![Edit README](https://github.com/shahednasser/awesome-resources/blob/master/assets/edit-README.png)

4. Find the correct category for your resource. For example, if it's a Javascript tutorial, you need to add it under [Javascript](https://github.com/shahednasser/awesome-resources/blob/master/assets/edit-README.png).
If the category does not exist, you can add it under [Content](https://github.com/shahednasser/awesome-resources/blob/master/assets/edit-README.png). **Resources are added in alphabetical order, except for Other which should stay last.**

To add a new category, add a list item with the name of the category and the URL to it (hash of the slug of the name). For example:

```
- [New Category](#new-category)
```

5. Once you find or add the correct category, add the new resource at the end of the list. It should have the title and the link to the resource. For example:

```
- [How to contribute](https://github.com/shahednasser/awesome-resources/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
```

6. Once you're done, scroll to the bottom of the list to commit the change. Make sure the title of the commit is relevant. For example: Added How to Contribute under New Category.

7. After adding the commit title, click on propose changes and follow the steps to create a pull request.

**That's it! Congratulations on participating in Hacktoberfest!**
